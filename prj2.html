<h2>Aims of This Project</h2>
<p>
The aims of this project are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<p><li>
To become adept with recursive programming.
</p>
<p><li>
To expose you to functional programming.
</p>
<p><li>
To familiarize you with imperative programming without
    destructive assignment.
</p>
</ul>
<h2>Project Specification</h2>
<p>
You are required to submit a <tt>prj2.tar.gz</tt> archive such that unpacking
that archive into an empty directory and changing into that directory
will allow you to run implementations of the following using the
racket dialect of Scheme installed on <tt>remote.cs</tt>.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>^</tt> operator is used below to indicate exponentiation.
</p>
<ol type="1">
<p><li>
Repeat <a href="../prj1/prj1.html">prj1</a> in Scheme.  Specifically,
      complete the code provided in the ugly-regexp <a href="./files/ugly-regexp/parser.rkt">parser</a> such that running the
      parser as:
<pre>
      $ ./ugly-regexp/parser.rkt FILE
</pre>
<p>
      translates <i>ugly regular expressions</i> to standard regex
      syntax exactly as in Project 1.  The output (including
      errors) should not be modified from that which is generated
      by the provided code.
</p>
</p>
<p><li>
Write a function <tt>(quadratic-roots a b c)</tt> which returns a
      2-element list containing the 2 roots of the quadratic equation
      <tt>a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0</tt> using the classical formula for the roots of
      a quadratic equation.  The first element in the returned list
      should use the positive square-root of the discriminant, the
      second element should use the negative square-root of the
      discriminant.  During the course of the computation, no
      expression should be evaluated more than once.
</p>
<p><li>
Write a function <tt>(mul-list list x)</tt> which when given a
      proper list <tt>list</tt> of numbers returns the list formed by
      multiplying each element of <tt>list</tt> by <tt>x</tt>.
</p>
<p><li>
Write a function <tt>(sum-lengths list)</tt> which when given
      a proper list <tt>list</tt> of proper lists returns the sum of the
      lengths of all the lists contained directly in <tt>list</tt>.
</p>
<p><li>
Write a function <tt>(poly-eval coeffs x)</tt> which evaluates the
      polyomial specified by list <tt>coeffs</tt> at <tt>x</tt>.  Specifically,
      given a list of <tt>n + 1</tt> numeric polynomial coefficients <tt>coeffs</tt>
      <tt>(c[n] c[n-1] ... c[0])</tt> and a number <tt>x</tt> return the value of
      <tt>c[n]*x^n + c[n-1]*x^(n-1) + ... + c[1]*x + c[0]</tt>.  Your
      computation should evaluate each term as written above;
      i.e. each <tt>c[i]*x^i</tt> term should be explicitly evaluated and
      added together.
</p>
<p><li>
Write a function <tt>(poly-eval-horner coeffs x)</tt> which uses
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner%27s_method">Horner's</a>
      method to evaluate the polynomial given by list <tt>coeffs</tt>
      at number <tt>x</tt>.  The list <tt>coeffs</tt> is as specified in (5).
</p>
<p><li>
Write a function <tt>(count-occurrences s-exp x)</tt> which given
      a Scheme s-expression <tt>s-exp</tt> returns the number of
      sub-expressions which are <tt>equal?</tt> to <tt>x</tt>.
</p>
<p><li>
Write a function <tt>(eval-arith exp)</tt> which returns the result of
      evaluating arithmetic expression <tt>exp</tt>, where <tt>exp</tt> is either a
      Scheme number or one of <tt>(</tt><i>op</i> <tt>exp_1 exp_2)</tt> where <i>op</i> is one
      of <tt>'add</tt>, <tt>'sub</tt>, <tt>'mul</tt> or <tt>'div</tt> specifying respectively the
      binary arithmetic operators <tt>+</tt>, <tt>-</tt>, <tt>*</tt>, <tt>/</tt>.
</p>
<p><li>
Write a function <tt>(sum-lengths-tr list)</tt> with the same
      specification as (4) with the additional requirement that all
      recursive calls must be tail-recursive.
</p>
<p><li>
Write a function <tt>(poly-eval-tr coeffs x)</tt> with the same
      specification as (5) with the additional requirement that all
      recursive calls must be tail-recursive.
</p>
<p><li>
Write a function <tt>(mul-list-2 list x)</tt> with the same specification
      as (3) but which replaces all recursion with the use of one or
      more of <tt>map</tt>, <tt>foldl</tt> or <tt>foldr</tt>.
</p>
<p><li>
Write a function <tt>(sum-lengths-2 list)</tt> with the same
      specification as (4) but which replaces all recursion with the use
      of one or more of <tt>map</tt>, <tt>foldl</tt> or <tt>foldr</tt>.
</p>
</ol>
<p>
The project is subject to the following additional restrictions:
</p>
<ul>
<p><li>
The solution for (1) must be in the file which unpacks into the
    file <tt>ugly-regexp/parser.rkt</tt>.  The archive should also contain
    any auxiliary files required by that file.
</p>
<p><li>
The solutions for (2-12) must be in the file <tt>fns.rkt</tt>.
</p>
<p><li>
The code created by you may not contain any use of Scheme's
    mutation operators; i.e. no Scheme function with name ending
    in <tt>!</tt> may be used.
</p>
<p><li>
Solutions 2-12 should not define any top-level auxiliary functions;
    i.e. any auxiliary functions needed for the operation of a
    required function should be defined within that function.
</p>
<p><li>
None of the functions may use <tt>map</tt>, <tt>foldl</tt>, or <tt>foldr</tt> unless
    explicitly specified.
</p>
<p><li>
Some of the function specifications give implementation
    restrictions.  Those must be followed.
</p>
</ul>

<h2>Provided Files</h2>
<p>
The <a href="./files">./files</a> directory contains the following:
</p>
<dl>
<p><dt><a href="./files/Makefile">Makefile</a><dd>
    This file contains a <tt>submit</tt> target such that typing <tt>make
    submit</tt> will create a <tt>prj2.tar.gz</tt> archive containing the files
    to be submitted. The <tt>clean</tt> target will remove the archive.
</p>
<p>
    You may edit this file if you choose to use a different
    organization for your project.  When editing, watch out for tabs
    (the first character of any command-line <b>must be a tab
    character</b>).
</p>
<p><dt><a href="./files/README">README</a><dd>
    A template README; replace the <tt>XXX</tt> with your name, B-number and
    email.  You may add any other information you believe is relevant
    to your project submission.  In particular, you should document
    the data-structure used for your word-store.
</p>
<p><dt>UglyRegexp <a href="./files/ugly-regexp/">Files</a><dd>
    Code for a ugly-regexp parser for exercise 1.  It consists of
    the following files:

      A skeleton file which will need to be completed by you.  It
      contains the necessary main function to start up the program
      well as all error handling and utility functions for parsing and
      translation.
</p>
<p><dt><a href="./files/ugly-regexp/scanner.rkt">Scanner</a><dd>
      A very crude scanner which streams delivers tokens to the parser
      while ignoring linear whitespace.
</p>
<p><dt><a href="./files/ugly-regexp/errors.rkt">Errors</a><dd>
      Trivial error reporting utility functions.
</p>
</dl>
<p><dt><a href="./files/fns.rkt">fns.rkt</a><dd>
    A file containing skeletons functions for exercises 2-12.
</p>
</dl>
<h2>Hints</h2>
<p>
You may choose to follow the following hints (they are not by any
means required).  They assume that you are using the project structure
supported by the provided <a href="./files/Makefile">Makefile,</a>.
</p>
<p>
You may choose to work within the <tt>drracket</tt> GUI tool or simply use
the <tt>racket</tt> CLI.  Documentation is available from within <tt>drracket</tt>
or from the web <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/">site</a>.
</p>
<p>
Exercise 1 simply requires reimplementing project 1 in a different
language and serves as an introduction to the syntax of Scheme.  The
provided skeleton <a href="./files/ugly-regexp/parser.rkt">parser</a> is derived
from the Java <a href="../prj1-sol/src/edu/binghamton/cs571/UglyRegexpParser.java">solution</a>.  The
following points are worth noting:
</p>
<ul>
<p><li>
The code for <tt>term</tt> and <tt>term-rest</tt> is isomorphic to the code
    for <tt>ugly-regexp</tt> and <tt>regexp-rest</tt> with the obvious changes.
</p>
<p><li>
The code for <tt>factor</tt> will require a decision based on the kind of
    the lookahead token.  Use a <tt>cond</tt> with calls to <tt>check?</tt>.  For
    <tt>chars</tt>, the <tt>factor</tt> function should take care of matching the
    <tt>CHARS</tt> token and it's parentheses, delegating the task of
    matching one-or-more comma-separated <tt>CHAR</tt>'s to the <tt>chars</tt>
    function.
</p>
<p><li>
You will need to use <tt>string-append</tt> as illustrated in the
    provided code for <tt>regexp-rest</tt> to build up the return'd
    translations.
</p>
<p><li>
When you need to name values for use in subsequent expressions,
    use <tt>let</tt> to set up the bindings.
</p>
<p><li>
It is worth looking at the correspondence between the provided
    code for <tt>parse</tt>, <tt>ugly-regexp</tt> and <tt>regexp-rest</tt> and the
    corresponding Java functions in the solution for Project 1.  This
    will give you some idea how Java constructs map into Scheme.
</p>
<p><li>
This exercise deals with I/O which is basically stateful.  Hence
    the code is imperative and it makes sense to have a sequence
    of Scheme expressions as can be seen in the exception-handling
    function used within <tt>parse</tt>.  This would not be true in the
    absence of side-effects. (Note that the code you add is still
    not allowed to use any destructive Scheme functions).
</p>
<p><li>
Note that in Scheme, the then-part and else-part of an <tt>if</tt> are
    syntactically restricted to be a single expression; if you need
    a sequence of expressions, then use a <tt>begin</tt> to wrap them into
    a single expression.
<p>
    Note that the bodies of <tt>when</tt>, <tt>unless</tt>, <tt>lambda</tt> and the clauses
    of a <tt>cond</tt> do not have such syntactic restrictions.  Hence it is
    possible to have such bodies contain multiple expressions without
    needing to wrap them within a <tt>begin</tt>.
</p>
</p>
</ul>
<p>
The following points are worth noting for the remaining exercises:
</p>
<ul>
<p><li>
It may be a good idea to initially ignore the requirement of not
    creating any new top-level functions. Once you have the code for a
    particular exercise working, then you can squirrel the definitions
    of any auxiliary functions into the body of the top-level
    function using <tt>let</tt>, <tt>let*</tt> or <tt>letrec</tt> as appropriate.
</p>
<p><li>
Almost all the exercises require recursive solutions. Hence you
    need to clearly identify your base case's and recursive case's.
    For the former, you will need to provide a basic solution not
    involving any recursive calls; for the latter you will need to
    figure out how to combine solutions from one or more recursive
    calls into a solution to the current call.
<p>
    In many cases, the recursive solutions will be based on the
    structure of the data: this is referred to as <i>structural
    recursion</i>.
</p>
<ul>
<p><li>
A list is either <tt>'()</tt> or a pair.
</p>
<p><li>
For the <tt>eval-arith</tt> function, an arith expression is either a
        Scheme number or <tt>(add exp-1 exp-2)</tt>, ... <tt>(div exp-1 exp-2)</tt>
        where <tt>exp-1</tt> and <tt>exp-2</tt> are themselves arith expressions.
        So for the base case, your evaluator function needs to return
        the evaluation of a Scheme number.  For the recursive cases,
        all you need to do is combine the results of the recursive calls
        to the evaluator on the subexpressions appropriately.
</p>
</ul>
<p>
    The <tt>count-occurrences</tt> function is one which requires you to
    process a Scheme expression to an arbitrary depth.  Make sure you
    clearly identify the base case (one of the examples provided in
    the log should help).
</p>
</p>
<p><li>
Except for the use of <tt>expt</tt> and <tt>sqrt</tt>, your code should not need
    the use of any Scheme library functions beyond those discussed in
    class.
</p>
</ul>
<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>
You will need to submit a compressed archive file <tt>prj2.tar.gz</tt> which
contains all the files necessary to build your jar file.
Additionally, this archive <b>must</b> contain a <tt>README</tt> file which should
minimally contain your name, B-number, email, the status of your
project and any other information you believe is relevant.
</p>
<p>
If you are using the suggested project structure, then the provided
<a href="./files/Makefile">Makefile</a> provides a <tt>submit</tt> target which will
build the compressed archive for you; simply type <tt>make submit</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Note that it is your responsibility to ensure that your submission is
complete.  To test whether your archive is complete, simply unpack it
into a empty directory and see if it runs correctly.
</p>
<p>
To submit the above archive, please use blackboard by following the
