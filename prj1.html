<h2>Aims of This Project</h2>
<p>
The aims of this project are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<p><li>
To familiarize you with recursive-descent parsing.
</p>
<p><li>
To expose you to Java programming.
</p>
<p><li>
To provide familiarity with the tools used to build programs
    on the <tt>remote.cs</tt> Linux systems.
</p>
</ul>
<h2>Project Specification</h2>
<p>
A <b>ugly-regexp</b> is defined inductively as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<p><li>
A <i>primitive</i> ugly-regexp is <tt>chars(</tt><i>x_1</i><tt>,</tt> <i>...</i><tt>,</tt><i>x_n</i><tt>)</tt> with
    <i>n</i> <tt>&gt;= 1</tt>.  The <tt>chars</tt> and the comma <tt>,</tt> occur literally, whereas
    the <i>x_1</i>, <i>...</i>, <i>x_n</i> represent any single character.  A <tt>chars</tt>
    ugly-regexp represents the character class containing the characters
    <i>x_1</i>, <i>...</i>, <i>x_n</i>.
</p>
<p><li>
If <i>U1</i> and <i>U2</i> are ugly-regexp's, then so are:
<ul>
<p><li>
<tt>(</tt> <i>U1</i> <tt>)</tt> representing the same ugly-regexp as <i>U1</i>.
</p>
<p><li>
<tt>*</tt> <i>U1</i> representing the Kleene closure of ugly-regexp <i>U1</i>.
</p>
<p><li>
<i>U1</i> <tt>+</tt> <i>U2</i> representing the alternation of ugly-regexp's
        <i>U1</i> or <i>U2</i>.
</p>
<p><li>
<i>U1</i> <tt>.</tt> <i>U2</i> representing the concatenation of ugly-regexp's
        <i>U1</i> and <i>U2</i>.
</p>
</ul>
</p>
</ul>
<p>
The operators precedences are strictly ordered <tt>.</tt> (lowest), <tt>+</tt>, <tt>*</tt>
(highest).  The <tt>.</tt> and <tt>+</tt> binary operators are left-associative.
The <tt>*</tt> prefix operator is allowed to nest, i.e., <tt>**</tt><i>U1</i> is legal.
Parentheses are used in the usual way to override the default
associativity and precedence.
</p>
<p>
An ugly-regexp is terminated by a newline.  Other linear-whitespace
(spaces or tabs) should be ignored.  It is assumed that an ugly-regexp
contains only ASCII characters.
</p>
<p>
Examples of legal ugly-regexp's, followed by a <tt>#</tt>-comment
containing the equivalent regexp in <i>"</i>standard<i>"</i> syntax:
</p>
<pre>
    chars(a, b)                                 #[ab]
    chars(,, ))                                 #[\,\)]
    chars(a, b) + chars(1, 2) . chars(3, 4)     #([ab]|[12])[34]
    chars(a, b) + **(chars(1, 2) . chars(3, 4)) #[ab]|([12][34])**
</pre>
<p>
[<b>Note</b>: the <tt>#</tt>-comment comment above is <b>not</b> the translation your
program is required to produce.]
</p>
<p>
An ugly-regexp <i>U</i> can be translated into standard regexp syntax using
a translation function <i>T(U)</i> which is defined as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<p><li>
If <i>U</i> is of the form <tt>chars(</tt><i>x_1</i><tt>,</tt> <i>...</i><tt>,</tt><i>x_n</i><tt>)</tt>, then
    <i>T(U)</i> is <tt>[</tt><i>x_1...x_n</i><tt>]</tt>.  If any <i>x_i</i> is not a letter or
    a digit, then it must be escaped by preceeding it with a single
    backslash character <tt>\</tt>.
</p>
<p><li>
If <i>U</i> is of the form <tt>(</tt> <i>U1</i> <tt>)</tt>, then <i>T(U)</i> is
    <tt>(</tt><i>T(U1)</i><tt>)</tt>.
</p>
<p><li>
If <i>U</i> is of the form <tt>*</tt> <i>U1</i>, then <i>T(U)</i> is <i>T(U1)</i><tt>*</tt>.
</p>
<p><li>
If <i>U</i> is of the form <i>U1</i> <tt>+</tt> <i>U2</i>, then <i>T(U)</i> is <tt>(</tt><i>T(U1)</i><tt>|</tt><i>T(U2)</i><tt>)</tt>.
</p>
<p><li>
If <i>U</i> is of the form <i>U1</i> <tt>.</tt> <i>U2</i>, then <i>T(U)</i> is <tt>(</tt><i>T(U1)T(U2)</i><tt>)</tt>.
</p>
</ul>
<p>
You are required to write a java8 program which will parse a ugly-regexp
and translate it into standard regexp syntax.  Specifically, submit a
<tt>prj1.tar.gz</tt> archive, which when unpacked into an empty directory on
the <tt>remote.cs</tt> machines, will build a <tt>target/prj1.jar</tt> jar-file when given
the command <tt>make</tt>.  When the generated jar-file is run using the command:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
   <tt>$ java -cp target/prj1.jar edu.binghamton.cs571.UglyRegexpParser</tt> <i>FILENAME</i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
will read ugly-regexp's from <i>FILENAME</i> (one-per-line) and output the
translation of each ugly-regexp on standard output followed by a
newline.  The program should read from standard input if <i>FILENAME</i> is
specified as a single dash <tt>-</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the submitted <tt>prj1.tar.gz</tt> archive <b>must</b> contain a
<tt>README</tt> file which should minimally contain your name, B-number and
email.  Additionally, it may contain the status of your project and
any other information you believe is relevant.
</p>
<h2>Rationale for the Requirements</h2>
<p>
This is basically a <i>"</i>make-work<i>"</i> project in that a ugly-regexp is
not particularly useful.  The rationales for the idiosyncratic syntax
included the following:
</p>
<ul>
<p><li>
The relative precedence of the alternation and concatentation
    operators in ugly-regexp's differs from that in standard regexp
    syntax.  This makes it impossible to do the translation using
    simple string replacement and requires writing a full parser.
</p>
<p><li>
Similar considerations led to the use of a prefix rather than
    suffix Kleene-closure operator <tt>*</tt>.
</p>
<p><li>
The translation introduces possibly redundant parentheses (in the
    translations for parentheses, alternation, concatenation).  This
    simplifies the translation function considerably.
</p>
<p><li>
Since whitespace is ignored, the ugly-regexp syntax does not allow
    any kind of whitespace characters within the constructed regexp's.
    This simplifies the scanner slightly.
</p>
</ul>
<h2>Example Log</h2>
<p>
Here is an annotated log of an interactive session with the program:
</p>
<pre>
$ java -cp target/prj1.jar edu.binghamton.cs571.UglyRegexpParser -
chars(a, b)
[ab]
* chars(,,)
&lt;stdin&gt;:2:11: syntax error at '      #syntax error at newline with newline
', expecting ')'                     #quoted within single-quotes
* chars(,)
[\,]*
chars(a) + chars(b) . chars(c)       #+ binds tighter than .
(([a]|[b])[c])
chars(a) + (chars(b) . chars(c))
([a]|(([b][c])))                     #double paren due to paren &amp; . translation
chars(a) + (chars(b) . *chars(c))
([a]|(([b][c]*)))
chars(a) + * * (chars(b) . chars(c)) # *'s nest
([a]|(([b][c]))**)
(chars(a,))                          #) after comma treated as chars char
&lt;stdin&gt;:8:11: syntax error at '
', expecting ')'
(chars(a,)))                         #fixed here
([a\)])
$
</pre>
<p>
Note that EOF is signalled to the Unix terminal-controller by typing
a control-D character.
</p>
<h2>Provided Files</h2>
<p>
The <a href="./files">./files</a> directory contains the following:
</p>
<dl>
<p><dt><a href="./files/Makefile">Makefile</a><dd>
    This file assumes that the project is set up to be built
    using a ant <tt>build.xml</tt> build-file.  Simply typing
    <tt>make</tt> will build the project, <tt>make clean</tt> will
    remove all generated artifacts and <tt>make submit</tt> will
    create a <tt>prj1.tar.gz</tt> archive containing the files
    to be submitted.
</p>
<p>
    You may edit this file if you choose to use a different
    organization for your project.  When editing, watch out for tabs
    (the first character of any command-line <b>must be a tab
    character</b>).
</p>
<p><dt>An ant <a href="./files/build.xml">buildfile</a><dd>
    This ant build-file compiles all source files from the <tt>src</tt>
    directory.  It generates<tt>.class</tt> files in the <tt>build</tt> directory
    and <tt>.jar</tt> files in the <tt>target</tt> directory.
</p>
<p><dt><a href="./files/README">README</a><dd>
    A template README; replace the <tt>XXX</tt> with your name, B-number and
    email.  You may add any other information you believe is relevant
    to your project submission.  In particular, you should document
    the data-structure used for your word-store.
</p>
<p><dt><tt>src</tt><a href="./files/src/"> </a><dd>
     Source files which contain all the code necessary for the
     project except for the guts of the regular expression parsing.
     Specifically it provides the following java classes (ordered
     from the bottom-up):
</p>
<dl>
<p><dt><a href="./files/src/edu/binghamton/cs571/Coords.java">Coords</a><dd>
         Essentially a <tt>struct</tt> which tracks the source position
         (filename, line-number, column-number) of a token.
</p>
<p><dt><a href="./files/src/edu/binghamton/cs571/Token.java">Token</a><dd>
         Essentially a struct which defines a token.  The
         implementation file also contains a <tt>Token.Kind</tt> <tt>enum</tt> which
         defines all the different types of tokens for this project.
</p>
<p><dt><a href="./files/src/edu/binghamton/cs571/Scanner.java">Scanner</a><dd>
         A very crude scanner which delivers tokens of kind <tt>Token.Kind</tt>
         while ignoring linear whitespace.
</p>
<p><dt><a href="./files/src/edu/binghamton/cs571/UglyRegexpParser.java">UglyRegexpParser</a><dd>
         A skeleton file which will need to be completed by you.  It
         contains the necessary <tt>main()</tt> function for your program as
         well as all error handling and utility functions for parsing
         and translation.
</p>

<h2>Hints</h2>
<p>
You may choose to follow the following hints (they are not by any
means required).  They assume that you are using the project structure
supported by the provided <a href="./files/Makefile">Makefile,</a> and ant
<a href="./files/build.xml">buildfile</a>.
</p>
<p>
Note that ugly-regexp's treat characters like <tt>(</tt>, <tt>)</tt>, <tt>,</tt>, <tt>.</tt> and <tt>+</tt>
in two different ways:
</p>
<ol type="1">
<p><li>
As meta-characters.  For example, <tt>.</tt> is used as a meta-character
      denoting concatenation.
</p>
<p><li>
As regular characters when used within <tt>chars()</tt>.  For example,
      (the first) <tt>,</tt>, <tt>.</tt> and <tt>+</tt> are not meta-characters in
      <tt>chars(,, ., +)</tt> (the comma's other than the first are
      meta-characters).
</p>
</ol>
<p>
A situation like this where the kind of a token depends on the context is handled usually in 2 ways:
</p>
<ol type="1">
<p><li>
The scanner recognizes such characters as special and delivers them
      to the parser as special tokens.  Then if the parser sees such
      a special token being delivered in a context where it should be
      treated as an ordinary character, it makes adjustments to treat
      it as a ordinary character.
</p>
<p><li>
The scanner treats such characters simply as regular characters.
      Then if the parser sees such a character being delivered in a
      context where it should be treated as a special character, it
      makes adjustments to treat it as a special character.
</p>
</ol>
<p>
The provided scanner uses (2).  The <tt>check()</tt> and <tt>match()</tt> utility
functions provided in the skeleton parser allow an optional <tt>lexeme</tt>
parameter which permits using the lexeme to guide parsing decisions.
</p>
<p>
You may proceed as follows:
</p>
<ol type="0">
<p><li>
Review material on regexp's, cfg's and recursive-descent parsers.
     Make sure you understand the following:
<ul>
<p><li>
The standard syntax of regexp's.
</p>
<p><li>
How to build a grammar to enforce specific associativity and
         precedence of operators.
</p>
<p><li>
How to transform a grammar to remove left-recursive rules.
</p>
<p><li>
How to construct a recursive-descent parser given a
         grammar amenable to recursive-descent parsing.
</p>
</ul>
</p>
<p><li>
Construct a grammar for ugly-regexp's which enforces the required
     associativity and precedence.  You may use the grammars given in
     the slides as guides; specifically, the grammars for
     comma-separated <tt>ID</tt>'s and arithmetic expressions may prove to be
     useful.
</p>
<p><li>
Transform the above grammar to remove left-recursive rules and
     make it amenable to recursive-descent parsing.
</p>
<p><li>
Add parsing functions to the <tt>UglyRegexpParser</tt> ignoring
     translation.  Your aim at this step should be to build a
     recognizer: i.e. if the provided input is syntactically legal
     then the program should terminate silently; OTOH,
     if the input is not syntactically legal, the program should
     output a suitable error message.  Since you are ignoring
     translation, set up all the parsing functions to simply return
     <tt>void</tt> or a <tt>null</tt> string.
<p>
     It may be best to do this from the bottom-up.  First get <tt>chars()</tt>
     working, then <tt>*</tt>, <tt>()</tt>, followed by <tt>+</tt> and <tt>.</tt>.
</p>
</p>
<p><li>
Add translation logic. Make each parsing function return a string
     which corresponds to the translation of the input recognized by
     that function.  Some of the parsing functions will need input
     parameters representing translations of input seen earlier.
<p>
     You may use the provided <tt>quote()</tt> function to quote characters
     within a character class as per the project requirements.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
     [Note: Standard Java practice suggests using mutable structures
      like <tt>StringBuffer</tt> or <tt>StringBuilder</tt> to concatenate strings;
      it may be difficult to do so in this program and you should
      simply use string concatenation using <tt>+</tt>).
</p>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p><li>
Test and review your code until it meets all requirements.
</p>
</ol>
<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>
You will need to submit a compressed archive file <tt>prj1.tar.gz</tt> which
contains all the files necessary to build your jar file.
Additionally, this archive <b>must</b> contain a <tt>README</tt> file which should
minimally contain your name, email, the status of your project and any
other information you believe is relevant.
</p>
<p>
If you are using the suggested project structure, then the provided
<a href="./files/Makefile">Makefile</a> provides a <tt>submit</tt> target which will
build the compressed archive for you; simply type <tt>make submit</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Note that it is your responsibility to ensure that your submission is
complete so that simply typing <tt>make</tt> builds the jar file.  To test
whether your archive is complete, simply unpack it into a empty
directory and see if it builds and runs correctly.
</p>
<p>
To submit the above archive, please use blackboard by following the
<tt>Content-&gt;Projects</tt> link.
